# SpeedCar-Prediction

Predicting velocity of a car from the front dashcam video.

Still need to implement the images prep, augmenting them with resize, change of brightness ecc..
The NN looks nice tho.

TODOs:
* implementing the normalization, when I switched to RGB it broke
* implementing the  random drop of pixels for the augmenting

Training loss goes down to about 4.5 during 10 epochs and the validations loss around 10 (It's getting somewhere!!)
